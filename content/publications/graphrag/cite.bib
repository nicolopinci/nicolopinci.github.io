  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture for Energy Efficiency (EE) Question Answering. First, the system automatically extracts a Knowledge Graph (KG) from guidance and regulatory documents in the energy field. Then, the generated graph is navigated and reasoned upon to provide users with accurate answers in multiple languages. We implement a human-based validation using the RAGAs framework properties, a validation dataset composed of 101 question-answer pairs, and some domain experts. Results confirm the potential of this architecture and identify its strengths and weaknesses. Validation results show how the system correctly answers in about three out of four of the cases (\$\$75.2\textbackslash pm 2.7\textbackslash\%\$\$75.2\textpm 2.7\%), with higher results on questions related to more general EE answers (up to \$\$81.0\textbackslash pm 4.1\textbackslash\%\$\$81.0\textpm 4.1\%), and featuring promising multilingual abilities (\$\$4.4\textbackslash\%\$\$4.4\%accuracy loss due to translation).},
