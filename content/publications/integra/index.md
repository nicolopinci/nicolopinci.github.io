abstract: This paper introduces Interactive Graph Analyzer (INTEGRA), a tool to support the comparison of simulated football matches with real ones, through the analysis of dynamic graphs. Our tool supports coordinated views of temporal graphs, benefiting from traditional node-link diagrams and graph visual rhythms, a recently proposed 2D image representation. Our proposal is generic and may be tailored to different applications. We demonstrate the use of this tool in compelling case studies related to the comparison of graph-based measurements obtained from three different kinds of simulated football matches and real ones. In particular, we exploit usage scenarios related to how graph measurements evolve over time.
