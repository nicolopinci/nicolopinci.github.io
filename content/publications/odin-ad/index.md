abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) in numerical temporal data series is a prominent task in many domains, including the analysis of industrial equipment operation, the processing of IoT data streams, and the monitoring of appliance energy consumption. The life-cycle of an AD application with a Machine Learning (ML) approach requires data collection and preparation, algorithm design and selection, training, and evaluation. All these activities contain repetitive tasks which could be supported by tools. This paper describes ODIN AD, a framework assisting the life-cycle of AD applications in the phases of data preparation, prediction performance evaluation, and error diagnosis.
