Energy consumption in buildings has been decreasing since 2008, mainly due to efforts observed in the residential sector and policy measures, as well as higher energy prices and the recession. The deployment and operation of proactive residential buildings will soon become yet another reason. The EU-funded PRECEPT project facilitated the smooth and almost zero operational costs transformation of conventional residential buildings into highly efficient proactive residential buildings. It is tapping into this new framework and is proposing a Pred(scr)ictive and Proactive Building Energy Management System (PP-BMS). By making buildings smarter as regards energy management systems, the project will develop new sustainable business models for transforming traditional reactive buildings into proactive buildings.
